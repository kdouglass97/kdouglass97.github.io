        <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/starrynight">Check out the original artwork!</a>

        <p>Rhizome is a company Wattenburg cofoundend, and the functional purpose of this website is to provide an
            artistically represented digital archive of emails
            for Rhizome's email discussion list.</p>

        <p>While NET ART ANTHOLOGY doesn't depict the original website's artistic expression, I believe they recognize
            this as NET ART ANTHOLOGY states "Users could navigate among them by selecting assigned keywords, which
            would draw “constellations” connecting related emails in the database."
        </p>

        <p>The original site idea was revolutionary at the time and the start of interactivity in websites. A problem I
            see with this form of interactivity is that when the database of people using the website, that the glow
            of the stars may become too strong, rendering the website unnavigable.
