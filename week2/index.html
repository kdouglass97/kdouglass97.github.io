        <p>
            The reading was interesting and resonated with me for a few reasons. 
            Primarily, it interested me because of the way this guy in the 1940s 
            was imagining and thinking about the endless possibilities of the 
            technologies that existed in his era, when in reality even his mind’s
            endless possibilities were short of the technology that we use every
            day in our daily lives. 

            It was interesting to note how we use the same actions that he
            mentions in the text, taking pictures, recalling, sharing, and 
            researching in our daily lives, yet the methods he describes make 
            the actions seem diligent. Where in our daily lives, these features 
            are used to complete simple things like homework assignments or 
            even used in leisure activities like social media. Weirdly it reminded 
            me of the idea that human nature doesn’t really change through time 
            but the technology and tools that we use change. 

            The author mentions the usage of films to be able to develop much more 
            tools for the average person is an interesting idea because he was 
            entirely right in the usage of creating user experience for various 
            technologies. The switch from going completely analog to digital allowed 
            for more information to be intuitively integrated into the same technologies 
            allowing people to do more often with less. Similarly it was this difference 
            that helped develop the internet from CLI to GUI.
